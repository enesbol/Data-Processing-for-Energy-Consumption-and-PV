# Data-Processing-for-Energy-Consumption-and-PV
****Project Goal:****
Finding the energy consumption and power consumption for 58 houses in the building from the sensor energy metric data of a building by applying the relevant electrical formulas on the data. The converted data will then be used to calculate the building's total power and energy consumption.



****Project Steps:****

1 - Filtering 70 million rows of data to 10 million rows to speed up data processing.

2 - Data Processing Steps (Logical operations - Time Series Operations)

3 - Finding increment between Watt/Hour Measurements.

4 - Finding time differences between measurements.

5 - Clearing inaccurate measurements between measurements.

6 - Adjusting the frequency of the data so that it is suitable for use in the formula.

7 - Finding energy consumption with appropriate electric formula.

8 - Calculation of power and energy consumption values â€‹ for 58 different houses in 15-minute intervals for 1 year. 

9 - Dynamic visualization of results.
